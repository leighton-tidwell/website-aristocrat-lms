# Aristocrat LMS
 Aristocrat LMS was a learning management system I developed from scratch for my school district as a capstone project while I was in highschool. It featured a number of functions such as:
 - A classroom news board
 - Timed and automatically graded quizzes
 - Automatic report card generator
 - Class manager
 - Functionality for multiple schools within a school district
 - Ability to turn in assignments online
And many more features that actually led to the adoption of it by my school district and a scholarship.

The Tech stack included:
- PHP
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- MySQL
